### Description

This tool is designed to assist TA's in helping students.  A TA can log in and
open the queue, and students can get in the queue to get help.  This helps in
keeping the students that need help in order and helps them so they don't have
to sit there with their hand raised, hoping the TA will see them before the
person across from them.  It also helps the TA know who needs help as well as
where those people are.

The Android app is a native version of the [web client](http://nine.eng.utah.edu/).
For instructions on downloading and building the code, see below.

--------
